Overview
========

`PEARL <https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg/pearl>`_ is a high-performance computing cluster, designed primarily for Deep Learning and AI research. At its core are two `NVIDIA DGX-2s <https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/dgx-2/>`_. Each DGX-2 utilises 16 Tesla V100 GPUs with a total of 512GB of GPU memory. Each also has 1.5TB of system RAM, two Intel Xeon Platinum CPUs and 30TB of NVME SSD local storage.
The DGX-2s are connected over 100Gbit/s EDR InfiniBand to two Boston Flash-IO Talyn servers which together provide half a petabyte of NVMe storage.

It is run by `STFC's <https://stfc.ukri.org/>`_ `Scientific Computing Research Infrastructures Group <https://stfc.ukri.org/about-us/where-we-work/rutherford-appleton-laboratory/research-infrastructure-group-rig/>`_ on behalf of the `Alan Turing Institute <https://www.turing.ac.uk/>`_ and it is hosted at STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.
