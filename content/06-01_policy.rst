At STFC (being a Council under, and part of, United Kingdom Research and Innovation), we intend to make sure that we maintain the UK as a world-leader in science and technology research - integral to this is our commitment to protecting and safeguarding your data privacy.

It is part of STFC’s public purpose to provide services such as PEARL. In order to effectively provide that service to you, we need to collect information about you and may need to contact you from time to time with regards to its provision.

STFC considers it in the legitimate interest of anyone who has signed up to access the PEARL service that it should be able to effectively and efficiently manage the service for their benefit. STFC therefore requests and securely holds the data which it requires for these purposes.

PEARL stores your name, affiliation and e-mail address in our user management and helpdesk systems. In addition our webserver and login nodes store the IP address you used to connect to them in their standard logs. We store information on the jobs you submit, including any scripts you pass to the batch system, and also which modules of our modules system you have loaded. Your e-mail address is shared with the JiscMail service - as part of our user registration process you will be registered to our PEARL-USERS mailing list hosted on JiscMail.
